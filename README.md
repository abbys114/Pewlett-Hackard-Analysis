# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to help Pewlett-Hackard better prepare for retirement of current employees.  We were able to take the data of the employees of Pewlett-Hackard and organize it to better understand who will be retiring and the positions that will need to be filled.  Tables were created to determine the number of retiring employees per title and employees eligiable to participate in a mentorship program.  The tables that we created will better help the company prepare for the future.

## Results
- Majority of the employees that will be retiring soon hold the title of Senior Engineer or Senior Staff
- A lot of engineering positions at all levels will need to be filled soon, due to a lot of engineers retiring soon
- According to the mentorship_eligibilty table, there is a large group of employees eligible for the mentorship program
- Many of the employees eligiable for the mentorship program hold a Senior Staff or Engineering title
